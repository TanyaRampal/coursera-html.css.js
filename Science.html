		<span id="sp1">	Immortal Footprints?? </span>
		<br> <br>
		The Apollo astronauts' footprints on the moon will probably stay there for at least 100 million years. Since the moon doesn't have an atmosphere, there's no wind or water to erode or wash away the Apollo astronauts' mark on the moon. That means their footprints, roverprints, spaceship prints, and discarded materials will stay preserved on the moon for a very long time.They won't stay on there forever, though. Erosion is definitely happening on the moon, just very slowly.

		One day on Venus is longer than one year on Earth. Venus has an extremely slow axis rotation that takes about 243 Earth days to complete one full cycle. Funny enough, it takes Venus even less time in Earth days in order to complete one revolution around the sun-226 to be exact. Also, the sun rises every 117 Earth days, ie the sun will rise only two times during each year. Since Venus also rotates clockwise, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east. Isn't that so cool?!

		Jupiter's moon Io has towering volcanic eruptions.For those of us used to Earth's relatively inactive moon, Io's chaotic landscape may come as a huge surprise. The Jovian moon has hundreds of volcanoes and is considered the most active moon in the solar system, sending plumes up to 250 miles into its atmosphere . Some spacecraft have caught the moon erupting; the Pluto-bound New Horizons craft caught a glimpse of Io bursting when it passed by in 2007. And how were we thinking volcanoes could only exist on earth!
